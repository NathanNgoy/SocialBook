## SocialBook

SocailBook is my take on creating the Facebook clone with the idea of providing a minimalistic social media website for users. This is the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/odin-book) of the NodeJS course on the Odin Project. The project provides core features of the platform such as users, profiles, posts, “liking”, “friending”, and the news feed.
